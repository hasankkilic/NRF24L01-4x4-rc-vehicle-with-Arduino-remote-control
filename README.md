# NRF24L01-4x4-rc-vehicle-with-Arduino-remote-control
Arduino remote control NRF24L01 4x4 rc vehicle construction

In this project, I used:

2 NRF24L01 modules
2 Arduino joysticks
2 Arduinos
A DC motor turning a 4x4 wheel
One SG90 servo motor for directional control
Since I didn't have a LiPo or lithium-ion battery on hand, I used an unused 14.4-volt drill battery to power the motor :)
